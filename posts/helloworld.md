I am really excited to try out this new blogging thing.
I have never been much of a writer, but I thought that it would be 
interesting to archive my experiences/thoughts somewhere so that I could
look back and see my evolution. I think it is a cool idea to capture my thoughts
at this point in time to perhaps look back at later. I probably will talk about
tech related things, since that is what is inside my brain at most moments in time. 
It wasn't always like this -- I started programming 5-ish years ago, so what did I think
about back then? 

Maybe I should make a brief history about my programming journey...

## D\(er\)_ik's programming journey:

- ### Learned programming in CSC 110

  This was in the winter of 2019, and I learned to program in python. I was majoring 
  in economics at the time. 

- ### Went all in on programming during the start of the pandemic

  Took CSC 115, CSC 230, CSC 225-226, SENG 265 and more importantly, started doing 
  side projects

- ### Learned Javascript XD

  This was paramount to building web applications

- ### Switched major to Computer Science

  YUP. 

- ### Did 4 internships + work part time as a front end developer

  I am a web developer now I guess. 


- ### TODO: graduate in Computer Science

  Almost there.

Stay tuned for more thoughts + posts!
