### Introduction {#introduction}
I am really excited to try out this new blogging thing.
I have never been much of a writer, but I thought that it would be 
interesting to archive my experiences/thoughts somewhere so that I could
look back and see my evolution. I think it is a cool idea to capture my thoughts
at this point in time to perhaps look back at later. I probably will talk about
tech related things, since that is what is inside my brain at most moments in time. 
It wasn't always like this -- I started programming 5-ish years ago, so what did I think
about back then? 

Maybe I should make a brief history about my programming journey...

### D\(er\)_ik's programming journey {#journey}

#### Learned programming in CSC 110

This was in the winter of 2019, and I learned to program in python. I was majoring 
in economics at the time. 

#### Went all in on programming during the start of the pandemic

Took many 100-200 level computer science/software engineering courses and more importantly, started doing 
side projects

#### Learned Javascript XD

This was paramount to building web applications

#### Switched major to Computer Science

YUP. 

#### Did 4 full stack internships + now work part time as a front end developer

I am a web developer now I guess. 


#### TODO: complete degree

Almost there.

Stay tuned for more thoughts + posts!
